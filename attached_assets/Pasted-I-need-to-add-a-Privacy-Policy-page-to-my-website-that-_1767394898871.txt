I need to add a "Privacy Policy" page to my website that matches the existing design.

Please perform the following 3 tasks:

### 1. Create a new file named `privacy.html`
Create this file in the root directory. It should share the same `<head>` (fonts, CSS links) as `index.html`. 
Inside the body, use a simple layout:
- **Header:** The same navigation bar as `index.html` (with the logo linking back to `index.html`).
- **Main Content:** A centered container (use a class like `content-container` or `legal-text`) containing the Privacy Policy text provided below.
- **Footer:** The same footer as `index.html`.

**Content for `privacy.html`:**
(Convert this text to clean HTML with <h2> and <p> tags):

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

### 2. Update `style.css`
Check if there is a class suitable for text pages (left-aligned text, max-width 800px, readable line-height). If not, please add a new class `.legal-content` to `style.css` to ensure the Privacy Policy looks good and isn't stretched across the whole screen.

### 3. Update `index.html`
Find the **Footer** section in `index.html`. Add a link that says **"Privacy Policy"** pointing to `privacy.html`. It should be placed near the copyright text or in the footer navigation links.
